PostgreSQL Application and Database Project with Patika.dev

This GitHub repository contains my work on PostgreSQL databases and applications. 
This repository was created to showcase my expertise and abilities with PostgreSQL.


Below is a list of SQL operators and topics for the tasks to be carried out:


1. `SELECT`
2. `WHERE` and Comparison Operators
3. WHERE and Logical Operators
4. `BETWEEN` and `IN`
5. `LIKE` and `ILIKE`
6. `DISTINCT` and `COUNT`
7. `ORDER BY`
8. `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
9. Aggregate Functions
10. `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
11. ALIAS
12. Creating - Deleting a Table
13. Updating - Deleting Data
14. `PRIMARY KEY` - `FOREIGN KEY`
15. Data Types I
16. Data Types II
17. `NOT NULL` and `ALTER`
18. `UNIQUE`
19. `CHECK`
20. PSQL and Application II
21. `INNER JOIN`
22. `LEFT JOIN`
23. `RIGHT JOIN`
24. `FULL JOIN`
25. `UNION`
26. `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`
27. What is a Subquery?
28. `ANY` and `ALL` Operators
29. Subqueries and JOIN Structure


Tasks:

Task 1: Data query study using and operators.

Task 2: Text search study with `LIKE` and `ILIKE` operators.

Task 3: Counting unique values with `DISTINCT` and `COUNT`.

Task 4: Data collection study with aggregation functions.

Task 5: Study of grouping and filtering the grouping results with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.

Task 6: Study of using `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY` for relational database design.

Task 7: Study on data types and column constraints.

Task 8: Database design study using `UNIQUE`, `CHECK` and `ALTER` commands.

Task 9: Data merging study with `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` and `FULL JOIN`.

Task 10: Dataset merging study with `UNION`, `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`.

Task 11: Data query study using subqueries and JOIN structure.


Applications:


PSQL and Application I: Database operations and basic application using the PostgreSQL command line tool (PSQL).

PSQL and Application II: PostgreSQL database operations and advanced application development.
